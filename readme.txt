Project Number: UDP Echo Programming with burst sending


How to build:
  Run a command shell, switch to my program dirctory, because there is a Makefile so you just need to type "make" to compile it. If you want to compile the whole program completely, you may need to type "make clean" and then type "make".

How to run:
  After you compile the program, you can type "./server <port number>" to run the server and type "./client <host name or IP> <host port number> <iteration interval> <data size> <burst size> <test duration>" to run the client.
